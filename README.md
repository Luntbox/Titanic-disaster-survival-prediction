# Titanic disaster survival prediction
 Using the Catboost library to predict Titanic survivors


This project involves using pandas to do preprocessing and cleaning of the Titanic disaster dataset, followed by feature selection and engineering. I then use the Catboost library to train a model to predict survivors and the shap library to analyse the results.
